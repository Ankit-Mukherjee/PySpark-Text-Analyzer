# Word Count and Co-Occurrence Analysis in PySpark

This repository contains a project that performs text analysis using PySpark. The project consists of two main parts:

1. **Word Count Analysis**
   - Basic word count: Count the occurrences of each word in a text file.
   - Extended word count: Normalize text (case-insensitive), remove punctuation, ignore stop words, and extract the most common words.

2. **Word Co-Occurrence Analysis**
   - Generate and count bigrams (two consecutive words) in the text to find the most common word pairs.

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on *Pinocchio* by Carlo Collodi, which is available from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). This book was chosen because of its literary significance and the variety of vocabulary, making it ideal for word frequency and co-occurrence analysis. you can choose anything you want.
